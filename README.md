# gh_gen_template
GitHub general template

## Includes:
- [/src/tests/tests.c](/src/tests/tests.c) - basic test file for C projects.
- [Makefile](/src/Makefile) - general Makefile for C projects.
- .github - contains a self-hosted CI workflow for a C project.

These files can be used for the project start, but must be adjusted according to your needs.
